# Trigger-Word-Detection

### Overview:
Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word. For this projcet, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound. 

We used GRU or Gated Recurrent Unit as our model. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem which comes with a standard recurrent neural network. GRU can also be considered as a variation on the LSTM because both are designed similarly and, in some cases, produce equally excellent results


### Requirements:
Python 3.x
